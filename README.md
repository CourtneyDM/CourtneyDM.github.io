### Who am I

I am an IT professional-turned Full Stack MERN developer who is looking to join a team of individuals with a broad understanding of web development technologies.

My passion for development started during my teenage years, where the first languages I learned were Pascal and C. The desire to deepen my knowledge grew stronger; I went on to receive a CS degree from the University of North Texas.

I have an extensive background in the IT industry; the past ten-plus years have allowed me to strengthen my communication, collaborative and leadership skills. I am an avid learner of all things web development, and am eager to knowledge share with others.


### Skills

I am proficient in front-end technologies, such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, React and APIs. I am also proficient with back-end technologies such as MySQL, MongoDB/Mongoose and MySQL. In addition to my knowledge of web development, I have a solid foundation in lower-level Object-Oriented programming languages such as C++ and C-Sharp (C#).
